<p id="5f192ece9c422824aba6b9d0b08eaa79" class="par"> The Egyptians were the first to cultivate beauty in an extravagant fashion. They used cosmetics as part of their personal beautification habits, religious ceremonies, and preparation of the deceased for burial. </p><a name="c3bbbe9d84977ea73aacedb267aef32c"></a>
<p id="c3bbbe9d84977ea73aacedb267aef32c" class="par">As early as 3000 BC, Egyptians used minerals, insects, and berries to create makeup for their eyes, lips, and skin. Henna was used to stain their hair and nails a rich, warm red. They were also the first civilization to infuse essential oils from the leaves, bark, and blossoms ofplants for use as perfumes and for purification purposes. Queen Nefertiti (circa 1400 BC) stained her nails red by dipping her fingertips in henna, wore lavish makeup designs, and used custom-blended essential oils as signature scents. Queen Cleopatra (circa 50 BC) took this dedication to beauty to an entirely new level by erecting a personal cosmetics factory next to the Dead Sea. </p><a name="bafa83bef0a8ec94519309270e17641e"></a>

<p id="d1fdc03a1c668ac866972aa7af467dae" class="par">Ancient Egyptians are also credited with creating kohl makeup-originally made from a mixture of ground galena (a black mineral), sulfur, and animal fat-to heavily line the eyes, alleviate eye inflammation, and protect the eyes from the glare of the sun. </p><a name="57fc7b5aab05465a1d80ca259ada6c43"></a>

<p id="8b0df512c406b1e4e1fbd47739b6daf3" class="par"> History also shows that during the Shang Dynasty (circa 1600 BC), Chinese aristocrats rubbed a tinted mixture of gum arabic, gelatin, beeswax, and egg whites onto their nails to color them crimson or ebony. Throughout the Chou Dynasty (circa 1100 BC), gold and silver were the royal colors. During this early period in Chinese history, nail tinting was so closely tied to social status that commoners caught wearing a royal nail color faced a punishment of death. </p><div ntiid="tag:nextthought.com,2011-10:MN-HTML-MiladyCosmetology.the_greeks" id="a0000000009" class="subsection title">

<p id="ead1008d4b032470c5564e44b6d4936b" class="par">During the golden age of Greece (circa 500 BC), hairstyling became a highly developed art. The ancient Greeks made lavish use of perfumes and cosmetics in their religious rites, in grooming, and for medicinal purposes. They built elaborate baths and developed excellent methods of dressing the hair and caring for the skin and nails. Greek women applied preparations ofwhite lead onto their faces, kohl around their eyes, and vermillion upon their cheeks and lips. Vermillion is a brilliant red pigment, made by grinding cinnabar (a mineral that is the chief source of mercury) to a fine powder. It was mixed with ointment or dusted on the skin in the same way cosmetics are applied today. </p><div ntiid="tag:nextthought.com,2011-10:MN-HTML-MiladyCosmetology.the_romans" id="a0000000011" class="subsection title">

<p id="61d889f3a6b557299949936c19270a3e" class="par">Roman women lavishly used fragrances and cosmetics. Facials made of milk and bread or fine wine were popular. Other facials were made of corn with flour and milk, or from flour and fresh butter. A mixture of chalk and white lead was used as a facial cosmetic. Women used hair color to indicate their class in society. Noblewomen tinted their hair red, middle-class women colored their hair blond, and poor women dyed their hair black. </p><div ntiid="tag:nextthought.com,2011-10:MN-HTML-MiladyCosmetology.the_middle_ages" id="a0000000013" class="subsection title">

<p id="c76ea64e6aa93edaeeddd46eb271078d" class="par">The Middle Ages is the period of European history between classical antiquity and the Renaissance, beginning with the downfall of Rome, circa AD 476, and lasting until about 1450. Beauty culture is evidenced by tapestries, sculptures, and other artifacts from this period. All of these show towering headdresses, intricate hairstyles, and the use of cosmetics on skin and hair. Women wore colored makeup on their cheeks and lips, but not on their eyes. Around AD 1000, a Persian physician and alchemist named Avicenna refined the process of steam distillation. This ushered in the modern era of steam-distilled essential oils that we use today. </p><div ntiid="tag:nextthought.com,2011-10:MN-HTML-MiladyCosmetology.the_renaissance" id="a0000000014" class="subsection title">

<p id="872333e2327a1adffcb8eedc0d3e02bf" class="par">This is the period in history during which Western civilization made the transition from medieval to modern history. Paintings and written records tell us a great deal about the grooming practices of the time. One of the most unusual practices was the shaving of the eyebrows and the hairline to show a greater expanse of forehead. A brow-less forehead was thought to give women a look of greater intelligence. During this period, both men and women took great pride in their physical appearance and wore elaborate, elegant clothing. Fragrances and cosmetics were used, although highly colored preparations of the lips, cheeks, and eyes were discouraged. </p><div ntiid="tag:nextthought.com,2011-10:MN-HTML-MiladyCosmetology.the_victorian_age" id="a0000000016" class="subsection title">

<p id="a10b8edaec2dd6fc8a66395fcb0ad28e" class="par">The reign of Queen Victoria of England, between 1837 and 1901, was known as the Victorian Age. Fashions in dress and personal grooming were drastically influenced by the social mores of this austere and restrictive period in history. To preserve the health and beauty of the skin, women used beauty masks and packs made from honey, eggs, milk, oatmeal, fruits, vegetables, and other natural ingredients. Victorian women are said to have pinched their cheeks and bitten their lips to induce natural color rather than use cosmetics, such as rouge or lip color. </p><div ntiid="tag:nextthought.com,2011-10:MN-HTML-MiladyCosmetology.the_twentieth_century" id="a0000000018" class="subsection title">

<p id="7833daa1266214830be2389d983226cb" class="par">In the early twentieth century, the invention of motion pictures coincided with an abrupt shift in American attitudes. As viewers saw pictures of celebrities with flawless complexions, beautiful hairstyles, and manicured nails, standards of feminine beauty began to change. This era also signaled the spread of industrialization, which brought a new prosperity to the United States. Beauty applications began to follow the trends set by celebrities and society figures. </p><a name="5950bc555c3afa62c2080781cf977e15"></a>

<p id="dfb96d380c27b2bd9cef2361936bd649" class="par">In 1904, Max Faktor emigrated from Lodz, Poland, to the United States. By 1908, he had Americanized his name to Max Factor and moved to Los Angeles, where he began making and selling makeup. His makeup was popular with movie stars because it wouldn&#8217;t cake or crack, even under hot studio lights. </p><a name="addc5c9582a52106dfc58bc0e22c5d67"></a>
<p id="addc5c9582a52106dfc58bc0e22c5d67" class="par">On October 8, 1906, Charles Nessler invented a heavily wired machine that supplied electrical current to metal rods around which hair strands were wrapped. These heavy units were heated during the waving process. They were kept away from the scalp by a complex system of counterbalancing weights that were suspended from an overhead chandelier mounted on a stand. Two methods were used to wind hair strands around the metal units. Long hair was wound from the scalp to the ends in a technique called spiral wrapping. After World War I, when women cut their hair into the short bobbed style, the croquignole (KROH-ken-yohl) wrapping technique was introduced. In this method, shorter hair was wound from the ends toward the scalp. The hair was then styled into deep waves with loose end-curls. </p><a name="fba62573906c5ea8a8245373e2c0147c"></a>
<p id="fba62573906c5ea8a8245373e2c0147c" class="par">One of the most notable success stories of the cosmetology industry is that of Sarah Breedlove. She was the daughter of former slaves and was orphaned at age seven when she went to work in the cotton fields of the Mississippi delta. In 1906, Sarah married her third husband, C. J. Walker, and became known as Madame C. J. Walker. Sarah suffered from a scalp condition and began to lose her hair, which caused her to experiment with store- bought products and homemade remedies. She began to sell her scalp conditioning and healing treatment called &#8220;Madam Walker&#8217;s Wonderful Hair Grower.&#8221; She devised sophisticated sales and marketing strategies and traveled extensively to give product demonstrations. In 1910, she moved her company to Indianapolis where she built a factory, hair salon, and training school. As she developed new products, her empire grew. She devoted much time and money to a variety of causes in Indianapolis, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the Young Men&#8217;s Christian Association (YMCA). In 1917, she organized a convention for her Madam C. J. Walker Hair Culturists Union of America. This was one of the first national meetings for businesswomen ever held. By the time of her death, she had established herself as a pioneer in the modern African- American hair care and cosmetics industry. </p><a name="592c4766b54ac300b3f2d70bc4219da9"></a>
<p id="592c4766b54ac300b3f2d70bc4219da9" class="par">In 1872, Marcel Grateau (AKA Francois Marcel) invented the first curling iron-tongs heated by a gas burner. Later, around 1923, he created an electric version. Because he introduced several electric versions, the actual date of the invention remains in dispute. Grateau went on to develop a permanent wave machine, barbers clippers, a safety razor, and other devices. </p>

<p id="de46e02b4700b82900083719e95767a9" class="par">The cosmetics industry grew rapidly during the 1920s. Advertising expenditures in radio alone went from $390,000 in 1927 to $3.2 million in 1930. At first, many women&#8217;s magazines deemed cosmetics improper and refused to print cosmetic advertisements, but by the end of the 1920s, cosmetics provided one of their largest sources of advertising revenue. </p>

<p id="b65a60384634ec63dfe66d3e8a2d5d9b" class="par">In 1931, the preheat-perm method was introduced. First, hair was wrapped using the croquignole method. Then, clamps that had been preheated by a separate electrical unit were placed over the wound curls. An alternative to the machine perm was introduced in 1932 when chemists Ralph L. Evans and Everett G. McDonough pioneered a method that used heat generated by chemical reaction: small flexible pads containing a chemical mixture were wound around hair strands, When the pads were moistened with water, a chemical heat was released that created long-lasting curls. Thus the first machineless permanent wave was born. Salon clients were no longer subjected to the dangers and discomforts of the Nessler machine. </p><a name="de9970410e8fda34dc9fd4a9788cfbb8"></a>
<p id="de9970410e8fda34dc9fd4a9788cfbb8" class="par">In 1932, nearly 4,000 years after the first recorded nail-color craze, Charles Revson of Revlon fame marketed the first nail polish-as opposed to a nail stain-using formulas that were borrowed from the automobile paint industry. This milestone marked a dramatic shift in nail cosmetics as women finally had an array of nail lacquers available to them. The early screen sirens Jean Harlow and Gloria Swanson glamorized this hip new nail fashion in silent pictures and early talkies by appearing in films wearing matching polish on their fingers and toes. </p><a name="1b2a0cb55c6d06e9523e363d7c2f4027"></a>
<p id="1b2a0cb55c6d06e9523e363d7c2f4027" class="par">Also in 1932, Lawrence Gelb, a New York Chemist, introduced the first permanent haircolor product and founded a company called Clairol. In 1935, Max Factor created pancake makeup to make actors&#8217; skin look natural on color film. In 1938, Arnold F. Willatt invented the cold wave that used no machines or heat. The cold wave is considered to be the precursor to the modern perm. </p><a name="766cf1994ab0aa1fcd222af50482d009"></a>

<p id="a4b0b766f161ecf6d6dafa9061dea656" class="par"> Up until the nineteenth century, many barbers also performed minor surgeries and practiced dentistry. In fact, the barber pole, a symbol of the barber-surgeon, has its roots in a medical procedure called bloodletting that was once thought to strengthen the immune system. The pole is believed to represent the staff that patients held tightly to make the veins in their arms stand out during the procedure. The bottom cap represents the basin used to catch the blood. The red and white stripes represent the bandages that stopped the bleeding and were then hung on the pole to dry. As the wind blew, these bandages would become twisted around the pole, forming a red-and-white pattern. </p><a name="e7c00251d2827ee6085f7893457510a9"></a>
<p id="e7c00251d2827ee6085f7893457510a9" class="par">The modern barber pole, then, was originally the symbol of the barber-surgeon, and is believed to represent the bandages (white), blood (red), and veins (blue) involved in bloodletting. Up until the end of the nineteenth century, even in the United States, both men and women wore wigs. Today wigs are making a resurgence as a fashion item, riding the popularity wave of hair extensions. </p><a name="880a7b9b4f260eb63167516d51fa3694"></a>

<p id="034c1f463fdc976eca99d5ad91d221c6" class="par">In 1941, scientists developed another method of permanent waving that used waving lotion. Because this perm did not use heat, it was also called a cold wave. Cold waves replaced virtually all predecessors and competitors. In fact, the terms cold waving and permanent waving became practically synonymous. Modern versions of cold waves, usually referred to as alkaline perms, are very popular today. The term texture services is used today to refer to the variety of permanent waving and straightening services available for various hair types and conditions. </p>

<p id="6afc300b7be23d55a20be085d9006418" class="par">The second half of the twentieth century saw the introduction of tube mascara, improved hair care and nail products, and the boom and then death of the weekly salon appointment. In the late 1960s, Vidal Sassoon turned the hairstyling world on its ear with his revolutionary geometric cuts. The 1970s saw a new era in highlighting when French hairdressers introduced the art of hair weaving using aluminum foil. In the 1980s, makeup went full circle, from barely there to heavily made-up &#8220;cat-eyes&#8221; and the heavy use of eye shadows and blush. In the 1990s, haircolor became gentler, allowing all ethnicities to enjoy being blonds, brunettes, or redheads. In 1998, Creative Nail Design introduced the first spa pedicure system to the professional beauty industry. </p><div ntiid="tag:nextthought.com,2011-10:MN-HTML-MiladyCosmetology.the_twenty_first_century" id="a0000000027" class="subsection title">

<p id="4ffeb442ed98afff4811a7f5917d834a" class="par">Toay, hairstylists have far gentler, no-fade haircolor. Estheticians can noticeably rejuvenate the skin, as well as keep disorders such as sunspots and mild acne at bay. The beauty industry has also entered the age of specialization. Now cosmetologists frequently specialize either in haircolor or in haircutting; estheticians specialize in esthetic or medical-aesthetic services; and nail technicians either offer a full array of services or specialize in artificial nail enhancements, natural nail care, or even pedicures. </p><a name="5dd67fab342962e4ce95695cd0f709f2"></a>
<p id="5dd67fab342962e4ce95695cd0f709f2" class="par">Since the late 1980s, the salon industry has evolved to include day spas, a name that was first coined by beauty legend Noel DeCaprio. Day spas now represent an excellent employment opportunity for beauty practitioners. </p><a name="4dd7ce3de8b8a7b794f3cf6382bf47f3"></a>
