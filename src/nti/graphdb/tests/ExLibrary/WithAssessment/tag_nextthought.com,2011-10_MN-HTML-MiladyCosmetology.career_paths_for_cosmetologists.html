    <dt>Salon trainer.</dt>

<p id="81af4c4efc8f9884b1ccf8643236ce2b" class="par">Many companies, such as manufacturers and salon chains, hire experienced salon professionals and train them to train others. This kind of training can take many forms, from technical training to management and interpersonal relationship training. A salon trainer can work with small salons, as well as large organizations and trade associations, to help develop the beauty industry&#8217;s most valuable resource-salon staff and personnel. </p></dd>


    <dt>Distributor sales consultant.</dt>
    <dd><a name="0422d09bb8372a1eb15b3ad3cb4ece8e"></a>
<p id="0422d09bb8372a1eb15b3ad3cb4ece8e" class="par">The salon industry depends heavily on its relationships with product distributors in order to stay abreast of what is occurring in the marketplace. Distributor sales consultants (DSCs) provide information about new products, new trends, and new techniques. This specialty provides an excellent opportunity for highly skilled and trained cosmetology professionals. The DSC is the salon and its staff&#8217;s link with the rest of the industry, and this relationship represents the most efficient method that outside companies use to reach the salon stylist. </p></dd>

<p id="f4eb7705431971af0702ac0149d3eecf" class="par"> <em>did you know?</em> Although cosmetologists who work in salons and spas do not have to join a union to be considered for work or to be entitled to certain benefits of employment, to work on films, television shows, and theater you may need to join a union. </p><a name="3edda436142d75ad558e330686038d6e"></a>

    <dt>Manufacturer educator.</dt>
    <dd><a name="9329fabe8f988f7d8b53e701313e9912"></a>
<p id="9329fabe8f988f7d8b53e701313e9912" class="par">Most manufacturers hire their own educators to train stylists and salon staff to understand and use the company&#8217;s hair care, haircolor, and chemical-service products. Mastery of the company&#8217;s product lines is a must for manufacturer educators. An accomplished educator who is a good public speaker ca:n advance to field educator, regional educator, or even platform educator, appearing on stage at shows in the U.S. and around the world. </p></dd>


    <dt>Cosmetology instructors.</dt>
    <dd><a name="4858168590479f5d14033aeba2aaab65"></a>
<p id="4858168590479f5d14033aeba2aaab65" class="par">Have you ever wondered how your instructor decided to start teaching? Many instructors had fantastic careers in salons before dedicating themselves to teaching new professionals the tricks of the trade. If this career path interests you, spend some time with your school&#8217;s instructors and ask them why they went into education. Educating new cosmetologists can be very trying, but it can also be very rewarding. </p></dd>


    <dt>Film or theatrical hairstylist and editorial stylist.</dt>
    <dd><a name="af22c10a03ef15d747937496b1953f6b"></a>
<p id="af22c10a03ef15d747937496b1953f6b" class="par">Working behind the scenes at magazine and Internet photo shoots or backstage on movies and TV sets all starts with volunteering to assist. Even someone right out of school can volunteer by calling agencies, networking with photographers, or asking other hairdressers who work behind the scenes for advice. The days are long-up to eighteen hours on soap opera sets-but once you clock the specific number of hours required by your state of residence, you can join the local union, which opens many doors. All you need are persistence, networking skills, reliability, team spirit, and attention to detail. This field requires constant continuing education, particularly in working with wigs, hairpieces, and makeup. </p></dd>

<p id="9477aba681a4c0b40144f0808804fbf0" class="par">If business is your calling, you will find that management opportunities in the salon and spa industry are quite diverse. They include being an inventory manager, department head, educator, special events manager (promotions), assistant manager, and general manager. With experience, you can also add salon owner to this list of career possibilities. To ensure your success, it is wise to enroll in business classes to learn more about managing products, departments, and-above all-people. </p><a name="da72d92908dc0eefa18910fb24f5da35"></a>
<p id="da72d92908dc0eefa18910fb24f5da35" class="par">Salon manager is a potential career path for a cosmetologist, but it requires a very different skill set. As a result, some managers oflarge operations are not cosmetologists. Salon managers must have an aptitude for math and accounting and be able to read documents such as profit and loss statements. They should understand marketing, including the roles of advertising, public relations and promotions, and what makes these programs successful. Much of management involves the business side of the salon-making it profitable-while keeping clients and employees happy. Titles and the accompanying responsibilities vary widely from salon to salon, and it is always possible to learn on the job. However, supplementing your experience with formal business education is the quickest path to success. </p><a name="73a7273f6e7d11fc32f9bf8d87818585"></a>
<p id="73a7273f6e7d11fc32f9bf8d87818585" class="par"></p><div id="a0000000035" class="sidebar"> <em>FYI</em> The field of cosmetology has broadened to encompass areas of specialization, including esthetics and nail technology. As the cosmetology industry continues to grow, opportunities for professionals increase. According to a study by the National Accrediting Commission of Cosmetology Arts and Sciences (NACCAS), salons employed around 1,683,000 professionals in 2007, and 53 percent of salons had job openings. Nearly three-quarters of salon ownders with positions to fill could not find qualified applicants, even though about 38 percent of the jobs were for inexperienced professionals with less than a year on the job. While many factors, including the national economy, affect the industry, the salon business usually withstands recessions much better than other industries. To make each day in school positively impact your future, focu on your studies, read trade publications cover-to-cover, become a member of relevant trade associations, and attend workshops outside of school. Remember, your license will unlock countless doors, but it is your personal dedication and passion that ultimately determines how successful you become. </div> <p></p><a name="2cd46c1f272595cbf99b3b0f5bb4e44a"></a>
