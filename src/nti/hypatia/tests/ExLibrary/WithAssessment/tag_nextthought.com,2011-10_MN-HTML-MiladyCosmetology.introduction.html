<p id="dee57af7d749d5d7fb68a12bba9bc953" class="par"><b class="bfseries">Cosmetology</b> (kahz-muh-TAHL-uh-jee) is a term used to encompass a broad range of specialty areas, including hairstyling, nail technology, and esthetics. Cosmetology is defined as the art and science of beautifying and improving the skin, nails, and hair and includes the study of cosmetics and their application. The term comes from the Greek word kosmetikos, meaning skilled in the use of cosmetics. Archaeological studies reveal that haircutting and hairstyling were practiced in some form as early as the Ice Age. </p><a name="f6c516250ce7d04526e5096f1fbbf59e"></a>

<p id="b831058f874252de2a79753fabaf86b5" class="par">The simple but effective cosmetic implements used at the dawn of history were shaped from sharpened flints, oyster shells, or bone. Animal sinew or strips of hide were used to tie the hair back or as adornment. Ancient people around the world used coloring matter on their hair, skin, and nails, and they practiced tattooing. Pigments were made from berries, tree bark, minerals, insects, nuts, herbs, leaves, and other materials. Many of these colorants are still used today. </p><div ntiid="tag:nextthought.com,2011-10:MN-HTML-MiladyCosmetology.why_study_cosmetology_history_and_career_opportunities_" id="a0000000004" class="subsection title">
